Welcome to the FreeStyle Libre Setup Assistant!

I can help you get started with your FreeStyle Libre device, understand your glucose readings, and troubleshoot any issues. Letâ€™s begin!

**Setup Overview:**

- Download the FreeStyle Libre 3 App:
  - For iPhone: Download from the App Store.
  - For Android: Download from Google Play Store.

**Apply the Sensor:**

- Select the site on the back of your upper arm. Avoid scars, moles, stretch marks, lumps, and insulin injection sites.
- Wash the site with plain soap, dry it, and clean with an alcohol wipe. Let it air dry.
- Unscrew the cap from the sensor applicator.
- Place the sensor applicator over the site and push down firmly. Gently pull the applicator away from your body.
- Ensure the sensor is secure and discard the used applicator as per local regulations.

**Start the New Sensor with the App:**
