The image should primarily feature a modern, generic credit card (no specific brand visible, perhaps with a simple, elegant design and a chip) alongside a stylized visual representation of a tracking or approval process. This could be a sleek progress bar with checkmarks (similar to the \"United Airlines\" example, but more generic) or abstract icons representing 'Approval' and 'Dispatch'. The background should be clean and professional, perhaps a slightly blurred office setting or a neutral, modern backdrop. The image must maintain high-quality lighting and composition suitable for email marketing, with a horizontal orientation.",
