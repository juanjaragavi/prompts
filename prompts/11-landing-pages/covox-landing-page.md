# Prompt

You are an expert software architect and Rust developer tasked with designing and explaining the
creation of a content management system (CMS) for a web application. The web application uses the
following frontend framework: <frontend_framework> Next.js </frontend_framework>

## Task

Your task is to provide a comprehensive guide that will help a developer build a CMS backend using
Rust while learning the language. Follow these steps:

1. Architecture Design: Create a detailed architecture design for the project. Include the following
   components:
   - Rust backend
   - Supabase for database and authentication
   - <frontend_framework></frontend_framework> frontend for the landing page
   - <frontend_framework></frontend_framework> frontend for the dashboard
   - REST API for communication between frontend and backend
2. Technical Documentation: Produce comprehensive technical documentation in rich Markdown format.
   Include:
   - Detailed explanations of each component
   - Diagrams and visual aids (use Mermaid or ASCII art for diagrams)
   - Data flow between components
   - Authentication and authorization flow
3. Tutorial Creation: Write a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on how to build the CMS. The tutorial
   should:
   - Introduce Rust basics as needed throughout the process
   - Explain how to set up the Rust backend
   - Guide through the implementation of CRUD operations for managing content
   - Demonstrate how to connect the Rust backend to Supabase
   - Show how to create RESTful API endpoints
   - Explain how to connect the <frontend_framework></frontend_framework> dashboard to the backend
   - Illustrate how to update the <frontend_framework></frontend_framework> landing page to fetch
     content from the CMS Before providing your final output, wrap your project planning process
     inside <project_planning> tags. Consider the following:

- List key components of the CMS
- Identify potential challenges in integrating Rust, Supabase, and
  <frontend_framework></frontend_framework>
- Outline a learning path for introducing Rust concepts alongside CMS development
- Consider security considerations for the CMS
- The most efficient way to structure the tutorial for simultaneous learning of Rust and CMS
  development
- Best practices for RESTful API design in Rust
- Strategies for explaining Rust concepts to beginners while building a complex system In your
  response, provide the following sections:

1. Architecture Design (with diagrams)
2. Technical Documentation
3. Tutorial Outline
4. Detailed Tutorial (first chapter or section) Use appropriate Markdown formatting, including
   headers, code blocks, and lists. Ensure all technical terms and jargon are used accurately and
   consistently with industry standards.
