# Document

```markdown

We have been tasked with creating a Google Docs document that outlines the steps to set up all of the necessary steps and actions to configure the DNS records for a new domain. Currently, we have several domains that we manage, and are registered on providers such as Hostinger (mostly) and GoDaddy. Then, the domains have their nameserver records changed, to make them point to the Google Cloud Platform Cloud DNS service, as you can see in the attached screenshots, which show the DNS records of one of the domains we manage (topfinanceus.com). We have a variety of DNS records set up, including A records, CNAME records, MX records, and TXT records, and special records like DKIM, DMARC, and SPF.

You have been tasked with creating a comprehensive guide on Google Docs that outlines the steps to set up all of the necessary DNS records for a new domain. This guide should start from the very beginning, assuming no prior knowledge of DNS configuration. The guide should include detailed instructions on how to access the domain registrar's control panel, how to change nameserver records to point to Google Cloud Platform Cloud DNS, and how to add and configure various types of DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT, DKIM, DMARC, SPF).

The guide should be written in Spanish and should be easy to follow, with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points where necessary. It should also include screenshots or images to illustrate each step of the process. The goal is to create a resource that can be used by anyone, regardless of their technical expertise, to successfully configure DNS records for a new domain.
