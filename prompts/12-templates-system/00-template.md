<Context>

The system is currently on the ActiveCampaign Portmark Dashboard main page (https://postmarkapp.com/email-api). The objective is to configure GlockApps to use ActiveCampaign's native SMTP service. This service, identified by DNS records such as `smtp.xxxx.com`, is reportedly handled by Postmark. Accessing the specific server credentials is required to complete this integration.

</Context>

<Task>

Locate the native SMTP settings within the ActiveCampaign platform. The specific parameters needed for the GlockApps integration are:

* SMTP Server URL (Hostname)
* Port
* Authentication credentials (Username and Password)
* Encryption settings (e.g., SSL/TLS)
