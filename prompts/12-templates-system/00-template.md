## ⚠️ Missing CTAs and Poor Image Placement on Product Pages

Product benefit articles within the **'Financial Solutions'** category suffer from inconsistent and missing Call-to-Action (CTA) implementations, which is a critical vulnerability for monetization.

The standard requirement for these pages is **two (2) buttons** that both lead to the product's **'requirements page'**. One of these buttons must be visible on the **first mobile screen (above the fold)**. Currently, numerous product articles are non-compliant, lacking one or both of these essential buttons.

Additionally, a recurring layout issue places product images at the bottom of the page. This frequently results in the **'AdUnit Mob'** (mobile ad unit) being the only visual element at the top of the article, creating a poor user experience.

## 🛠️ Implement Standard CTAs and Refactor Image Layout

### 1. Codebase Audit

Audit all of the articles in the Financial Solutions category, looking for posts that are **non-compliant** with the conditions above.

### 2. CTA Implementation

Implement the mandatory two-button configuration across **all 'Financial Solutions' product benefit articles**. Perform the task in batches of 5 articles to ensure accuracy and consistency.

* **Requirement:** Each article must have two buttons.
* **Link Target:** Both buttons must link to the corresponding product's 'requirements page'.
* **Mobile Layout:** One of the two buttons must be visible on the first mobile viewport (first screen).

### 3. Image Layout Correction

Refactor the layout of these articles to improve initial visual engagement.

* **Requirement:** Relocate relevant product images from the bottom of the page to the top.
* **Success Criteria:** A product-specific image must render on the initial screen, ensuring the 'AdUnit Mob' is not the sole introductory visual element.
