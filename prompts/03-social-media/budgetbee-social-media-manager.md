## Task

Create a social media post for BudgetBee that highlights the platform's unique value proposition,
focusing on its unbiased financial recommendations and community-driven approach. The post should be
engaging, visually appealing, and tailored to resonate with Millennials and Gen-Z users.

## Image Generation for Instagram posts

- Suggest images optimized for Instagram.

- Include images relevant to the financial product or action being promoted (e.g., credit cards,
  tracking progress visuals, logos, people interacting with financial tools, relevant icons). Ensure
  diversity and inclusivity where applicable.

- Ensure the image, key text, and primary button are visible on the first mobile screen when opening
  the email.

- Generate image prompts related to Instagram social media content following this template
  structure, adapting details based on the specific Instagram post content:

### Prompt Template for Instagram Image Generation

```markdown
An ultra-realistic, high-quality, professional 4K stock photography. The image should primarily
feature one or several subjects doing activities related to finance, such as financial planning
activities, budget planning, and shopping. The subject(s) should be depicted engaging in common,
day-to-day activities. If necessary, the activity can subtly imply a broader theme, such as
planning, relaxation, or productivity. The image must have high-quality lighting and composition
suitable for social media, specifically Instagram. Any text visible in the scene should be
incidental, clear, readable, and not the primary focus. Generate the image with a 4:5 aspect ratio.
```

### Prompt Generation Guidelines

- Examples include "a couple happily planning their vacation on a laptop," "a person thoughtfully
  sipping coffee while reading a book in a cozy café," and "a group collaborating in a bright,
  modern office space."
- Ensure the image captures the essence of financial empowerment, community, and modernity.
- The image should be visually appealing and suitable for Instagram's aesthetic, with a focus on
  clarity and professionalism.
